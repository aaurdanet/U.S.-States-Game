U.S. States Game

This is a simple game built in Python using the Turtle graphics library and pandas to help you learn the names of the U.S. states. In this game, you will be prompted to guess the names of U.S. states, and the program will provide feedback on whether your guesses are correct or not.
Prerequisites

To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You also need to have the following libraries installed:

turtle
pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas

How to Play

Run the script using Python.
A window titled "U.S States Game" will appear, displaying a map of the United States with the outlines of the states.
You will be prompted to guess the names of U.S. states one by one.
Type the name of a state in the prompt and press Enter.
If your guess is correct, the name of the state will appear on the map, and your score will increase.
Keep guessing until you have correctly guessed all 50 states, or type "Exit" to end the game.
After the game ends, a report will be generated with the states you guessed correctly and the states you still need to study.

Additional Notes

The game will track your score and display it in the title bar of the window.
If you need to exit the game before guessing all 50 states, you can type "Exit" in the prompt to end the game.
The map will display the names of the states you guess correctly in black text.
Once you have guessed all 50 states, a report will be generated with the states you guessed correctly and the states you still need to study. This report will be saved as two separate CSV files: "guessed_states.csv" and "states_to_study.csv".
